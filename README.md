## project 1
Everyone might have a friend who never forgets important dates in the lives of his or her friends. Let’s 
write a program to
1. read your address book to a list; 
2. update the list from the keyboard; 
3. write the current list into an output file; 
4. when a moth is given, display the names and phone numbers of all the people who have birthdays 
within the given month, so you can make phone calls to your friends. 

## project 2
use linked lists to implement a micro-version of Facebook.<br><br>
• P <name> – Create a person record of the specified name. You may assume that no two people have 
the same name.<br>
• F <name1> <name2> — Record that the two specified people are friends.<br>
• U <name1> <name2> — Record that the two specified people are no longer friends.<br>
• L <name> — Print out the friends of the specified person. • Q <name1> <name2> — Check whether the two people are friends. If so, print “Yes”; if not, print 
“No”<br>
• X – terminate the program.<br>

## project 3 
keep track of the hierarchical structure of an organization’s changing staff.<br> 
As the first event in the life of an organization, the chief executive officer (CEO) is named.<br>
Subsequently, any number of hires and fires can occur. Any member of the organization (including the CEO) 
can hire any number of direct subordinates, and any member of the organization (including the CEO) can 
be fired.<br>
The organization’s hierarchical structure can be represented by a tree.
